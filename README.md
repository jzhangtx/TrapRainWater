Trapping Rain Water


Given an array A where each element denotes a the height of blocks, calculate the total volume of water that can be trapped when it rains.

Note: one cubic block has a volume of 1 unit.

Example:
A: [ 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1 ]

The total volume of water is 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 6 units.
